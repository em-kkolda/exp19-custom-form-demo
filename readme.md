# Ellie Mae Experience 2019 Custom Form Demo

These files are provided as a reference for the demo given during the Experience 2019 Breakout Session entitled "Customizing the Loan Office Experience". The sample project includes a zipped custom form along with the code that copies form data between fields (both via the UI control as well as the loan) and also how to open and interact with a pop-up window that loads a remote web site.
